#About

This is a simple mutliplayer incremental game build in node.js. The main purpose of this project was to learn how to use some node.js technologies with each other.
Currently, it's unsupported and no longer actively worked on, due to poor design choices made at the beginning of this project.

#Requirements

- Node.js v4.4.5
- Redis

#Installation
